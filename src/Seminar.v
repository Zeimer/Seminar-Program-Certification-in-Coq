(** * Seminar: Induction *)

(** These are notes for my talk on "Inductive predicates" which I gave during
    a seminar called "Program certification in Coq". They turned out to be a
    bit broader than just inductive predicates and cover all forms of
    structural induction, including functional induction, and even more, but
    they do not touch the topic of well-founded induction, though.

    The grading policy is at the end. *)

(** * Inductive propositions and types with a grain of axioms *)

(** Let's start with inductive propositions: *)

Print False.
(* ===> Inductive False : Prop := *)

Print True.
(* ===> Inductive True : Prop :=
            | I : True *)

(** [False] and [True] have very simple definitions. [False] doesn't have
    any constructors and [True] does have one, called [I]. This name is
    arbitrary — it has to be there, because constructors can't be nameless,
    but doesn't really matter, because we're only interested in its existence,
    not name.

    The definitions are not that interesting if you have seen them already,
    so let's have a look at something weirder: *)

Inductive VeryTrue : Prop :=
    | proof : VeryTrue
    | other_proof : VeryTrue.

(** How is this one different from [True]? Well, [False], [True] and
    [VeryTrue] can be likened to [Empty_set], [unit] and [bool]: *)

Print Empty_set.
(* ===> Inductive Empty_set : Set := .*)

Print unit.
(* ===> Inductive unit : Set :=
            | tt : unit *)

Print bool.
(* ===> Inductive bool : Set :=
            | true : bool
            | false : bool *)

(** The similarities are striking — these two series of types from a
    high-level point of view look (nearly) the same. The dissimilarities
    are more subtle.

    Besides names the only difference lies in the sorts — [Prop] and
    [Set] — but it's a colossal one.

    Note: if a proof isn't there, it's an exercise. *)

Theorem VeryTrue_inhabited : VeryTrue.

(** First off, both [bool] and [VeryTrue], which correspond in the series,
    are inhabited. This means that [bool] has an element and [VeryTrue] is
    indeed true. No surprise here. *)

(** Secondly, [unit] is contractible and [bool] is not. This means roughly
    that [unit] has one element and [bool] has more than one (in fact it
    has two). We could believe that this is also the case for [True] and
    [VeryTrue], but it's not that simple. *)

(** Even though [True] has the same property that holds for [unit],
    it looks like the trickery of [inversion] is not enough to prove
    that [VeryTrue] is contractible. *)

Qed.
(* end hide *)

(** No, it's not about lack of trickery — it may simply be not true. In
    fact, it's axiom-dependent. In vanilla Coq we can't do much, but if
    we assume the Axiom of Proof Irrelevance, we can prove that both
    constructors of [VeryTrue] construct the very same proof. *)

Check proof_irrelevance.
(* ===> proof_irrelevance :
        forall (P : Prop) (p1 p2 : P), p1 = p2 *)

(** The Axiom of Proof Irrelevance states that all proofs of any proposition
    are equal. This is exactly the statement we wanted to prove. You may
    wonder if we're allowed to assume such an axiom, but it was proved
    that this axiom is consistent with the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
    (so, it won't introduce any contradictions to Coq).

    But before we go on we have to clarify what was meant by "proof" in the
    above statement in order to avoid falling into an equivocation lurking
    in the darkness out there.

    In the context of Coq the word "proof" can mean two things:
    - "proofterm". Proofterm is just a term. To prove [P] we have to
      construct [p : P] and this [p] is the proofterm that proves [P].
    - "proofscript". A proofscript is the text that appears between the
      theorem statement and the keyword [Qed]. *)

(** What I meant by "all proofs of any proposition are equal" could be
    better rephrased as "all proofterms of any proposition are equal". *)

    These are not the only differences. *)

(** Even though there are functions going from [unit] to [bool] and the
    other way around too, they are in no sense equivalences. Particularly,
    [unit] is not in bijection with [bool]. *)

(* end hide *)

(** Since Leibniz it is known that two equal things must also have the
    same properties. Using this fact we can prove that [unit] is not
    equal to [bool] (since they differ in the property of being in
    bijection with [unit]). *)

Theorem VeryTrue_True : VeryTrue <-> True.
(* begin hide *)
Proof. firstorder. Qed.
(* end hide *)

(** [VeryTrue] and [True] are, however, logically equivalent. This really
    shouldn't surprise us, because both can be proved without any assumptions.
    But this is not all that's true about their relationship. *)

(** From the Axiom of Proof Irrelevance it follows that [VeryTrue] and
    [True] are in bijection with each other. This too isn't that much
    of a surprise because we have shown before that they both are
    contractible, i.e. both have only a single element. *)

(** This axiom states that if two propositions are logically equivalent,
    then they are equal. It also has been proved that adding it to Coq
    is consistent (even if we already have proof irrelevance). *)

Axiom prop_ext : prop_extensionality.

(** Note: assuming this axiom is technically realized differently than
    assuming [proof_irrelevance]. To assume [proof_irrelevance], we only
    had to import the relevant module and the axiom was sitting there
    waiting for us. However, to assume [prop_extensionality] we have to
    write it out explicitly after importing the module. *)

Theorem VeryTrue_is_True : VeryTrue = True.
(* begin hide *)
Proof.

Qed.
(* end hide *)

(** Using this axiom, we can prove that [VeryTrue] and [True] are not only
    logically equivalent and in bijection with each other, but actually
    equal. Propositions are very different from ordinary types. *)

End Classical.

(** Let's try to sum up the above lesson using slogans and metaphors.
    An often repeated phrase is "propositions as types". By this it is
    most often meant that proposition can be represented by types and
    logic can be reduced to operations on types.

    This is mostly accurate, but as we have seen, proposition and types
    are not exactly the same thing in Coq. We can imagine that a type is
    just a bag of dots. The bag is the type proper and the dots are just
    repeated applications of the type's constructors.

    We can then in search of dots put our hand into the bag and if there
    are some, we can pull them out. If there are many of them, we can
    distinguish them by looking at them or doing more complicated operations.

    Propositions can be thought of as bags of dots in the same way, but if
    we put our hand into the bag, only two things can possibly happen:
    - We pull out a big blob of glue with some dots glued to it. We can't
      unglue them, but we know there are some dots
    - There's nothing *)

(** The moral of this story is as follows: in case of types (those terms
    whose type is [Set] or [Type], to be more precise) we are interested
    in what the terms look like, how many are there and so on. In the
    case of propositions (terms whose type is [Prop]) we can possibly
    only be interested in whether there are any terms (proofs) or not. *)

(** **** Exercise (easy) *)

(** Prove that [bool <> nat]. *)

(** * On the number of constructors *)

(** Let's consider how the truth of a proposition depends on the number
    of its constructors. *)

Inductive TheTruest : Prop :=
    | ShortProof : TheTruest
    | LongProof : TheTruest -> TheTruest.

(** This proposition dangerously resembles the type [nat]. It appears to
    have an infinite amount of proofs constructred by two constructors,
    one of which corresponds to [0] and the other to [S]. *)

Theorem TheTruest_True : TheTruest <-> True.
(* begin hide *)
Proof. repeat constructor. Qed.
(* end hide *)

Theorem TheTruest_contractible :
  forall x y : TheTruest, x = y.
(* begin hide *)
Proof.
  apply proof_irrelevance.
Qed.
(* end hide *)

(** This is not really the case. Since all the proofs are equal to each
    other, there in fact is only a single proof. So even though this
    proposition has two constructors one of which is recursive, it
    resembles [unit] more than [nat], to which it would be equivalent
    if it lived in [Set] or [Type].

    This leads us to ask a somewhat contrived question: for propositions,
    are all constructors besides one useless? Or rather, does a single one
    suffice to make a proposition true? *)

Inductive BePatient : Prop :=
    | the_longest_proof : BePatient -> BePatient.

(** The above proposition has a single constructor, so we could be led
    to believe it's true. *)

Theorem BePatient_false : ~ BePatient.
(* begin hide *)
Proof. induction 1. trivial. Qed.
(* end hide *)

Theorem BePatient_False : BePatient <-> False.
(* begin hide *)
Proof.
  split.
    apply BePatient_false.
    inversion 1.
Qed.
(* end hide *)

(** However it happens that this proposition is not at all true. How is
    this possible? It has a constructor, so it must be true... not quite.
    Recall that we can build terms of inductive types by applying their
    constructors only a _finite_ number of times.

    The "word" finite is crucial here. If we try to apply the constructor
    [the_longest_proof] repeatedly, our only hope at finishing is if we
    do it _ad infinitum_. This is exactly the thing that is forbidden by
    the definition of inductive types.

    So, a proposition with one constructor can be false. We could add
    more constructors like [the_longest_proof] and they wouldn't help
    if all of them were recursive. Thus we have proven (but only at the
    metatheoretical level) that a false proposition can have any number
    of constructors: 0 ([False]), 1 ([BePatient]), 2 or more ([BePatient]
    on steroids with more constructors).

    But what about nonrecursive constructors? Can a proposition with a
    nonrecursive constructor be false? *)

Inductive LatentFalsity : Prop :=
    | I_am_true : False -> LatentFalsity.

(** Well, this one has one nonrecursive constructor, so again we could be
    led to believe it's true... but beware. *)

Theorem LatentFalsity_false : ~ LatentFalsity.
(* begin hide *)
Proof.
  destruct 1. destruct H.
Qed.
(* end hide *)

Theorem LatentFalsity_False : LatentFalsity <-> False.
(* begin hide *)
Proof. firstorder. Qed.
(* end hide *)

(** This proposition is false because its only constructor takes a proof
    of [False] as an argument. Since there isn't one, this constructor can
    never be used to build a proof of [LatentFalsity].

    Our voyage into the land of constructors looks rather grim. We have
    met false propositions with any number of constructors, recursive or
    not. We have also seen that true propositions can have one or more
    constructors.

    The only certainty we discovered is that a proposition without any
    constructors must necessarily be false. As soon as it has at least
    one, it can be provable or not depending on how they look like. *)

(** * Induction and induction principles for types *)

(** Let's say we want to prove that all elements of a type [T] have some
    property. How can we go about it? There are three possibilites that
    depend on the particular form of [T].

    First of all, if [T] is finite, then we can prove our desired statement
    just by considering each element of [T] separately. This reasoning can
    be captured by a case analysis principle. Such a principle is a theorem
    of the form [forall P : T -> Prop, P x1 -> ... -> P xN -> forall x : T,
    P x], where [x1], ..., [xN] are all the elements of [T].

    Let's see an example case analysis principle for [bool]: *)

Check bool_ind.
(* ===> bool_ind :
        forall P : bool -> Prop,
          P true -> P false -> forall b : bool, P b *)

(** Note: [bool_ind] is the case analysis principle for [bool] that Coq
    automatically generated for us. The suffix [_ind] stands for induction,
    since case analysis principles are a special case of induction principles.
    Because induction principles can be used not only to prove that all terms
    have some property, but also to define a dependent function, Coq actually
    generates us three principles for each definition we make.

    For type [T] these are called [T_rect], [T_rec] and [T_ind]. They differ
    only in the sort of the type that depends on [T]: for [T_rect] this is
    [Type], for [T_rec] it's Set and for [T_ind] it's [Prop]. The two latter
    are implemented by simply calling [T_rect].

    We see that in order to prove that all terms of type [bool] have some
    property, we only have to prove that [true] has it and that [false]
    also has it. This is because these two are the only terms of type [bool].*)

Print bool_rect.
(* ===> bool_rect =
        fun (P : bool -> Type)
            (f : P true) (f0 : P false) (b : bool) =>
              if b as b0 return (P b0) then f else f0
        : forall P : bool -> Type, P true -> P false ->
            forall b : bool, P b *)

(** When we look at the definition we can see an [if] here. This is just a
    syntactic sugar for [match], which shows us that the principle is not
    magical or built-in and can be derived manually using pattern matching.

    But how to use this principle to prove something? *)

Theorem negb_involutive' :
  forall b : bool, negb (negb b) = b.
Proof.
  apply bool_ind; cbn; trivial.
Restart.
  destruct b; cbn; trivial.
Qed.

(** Since an induction principle is just a normal theorem, we can apply it
    like a theorem. This is precisely what the [destruct] tactic does — it
    applies for us the standard case analysis principle associated with the
    type of its argument.

    Let's get back to our question of how to prove that all terms of some
    type have some property. The above was just the finite case for inductive
    types. But what if our type is infinite?

    This is the second case. In general, if our type is infinite and we want
    to be done with our proving in finite time and using finite resources,
    then we're doomed. A representative example of this case are functions
    [nat -> nat] — there are so many of them that we can't prove anything
    nontrivial about all of them.

    Not all hope is lost, however. The third case is: our type is infinite,
    but defined inductively. In this case we can do as much as in the finite
    case. Even though we can't check each element of [T] separately, we know
    that it is "finitely generated", meaning that it can be constructed by
    applying one of finitely many constructors of [T] a finite number of
    times.

    It turns out this is enough for us. Let's see how the induction principle
    for [nat] looks like. *)

Check nat_ind.
(* ===> nat_ind :
        forall P : nat -> Prop,
          P 0 -> (forall n : nat, P n -> P (S n)) ->
            forall n : nat, P n *)

(** To prove that all natural numbers have the property [P], we only have
    to prove that [0] has it and that [S n] has it under the assumption that
    [n] does. This is because these two constructors are everything we need
    in order to generate all natural numbers.

    The second argument is of particular interest to us: if it were
    [forall n : nat, P (S n)], we would only have a case analysis
    principle. However, it also has the premise [P n], which makes it
    recursive. *)

Print nat_rect.
(* ===> nat_rect =
        fun (P : nat -> Type) (f : P 0)
            (f0 : forall n : nat, P n -> P (S n)) =>
        fix F (n : nat) : P n :=
        match n as n0 return (P n0) with
            | 0 => f
            | S n0 => f0 n0 (F n0)
        end
        : forall P : nat -> Type,
            P 0 -> (forall n : nat, P n -> P (S n)) ->
              forall n : nat, P n *)

(** As we see, this principle too is neither magical nor built-in. It can
    be derived manually using just pattern matching and recursion. This is
    the case for all induction principles of inductive types: they can be
    derived manually using [match] and [fix]. *)

Theorem plus_assoc' :
  forall a b c : nat, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c.
Proof.
  apply nat_ind.
Restart.
  apply (nat_ind
  (fun a : nat => forall b c : nat, a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c)).
    cbn. trivial.
    cbn. intros. rewrite H. trivial.
Restart.
  induction a; cbn; intros.
    trivial.
    rewrite IHa. trivial.
Defined.

(** As in the case of [bool_ind], we can use our induction principle just
    by applying it. This time however it is a bit harder: simply doing
    [apply] is weird, because it produces three goals, first of which is
    equivalent to the original one, the second is a trivial implication and
    the third asks us for a natural number.

    It works that way because Coq can't guess what is the [P : nat -> Prop]
    that we want to use [nat_ind] with. We can solve this problem by giving
    it manually, just as in our second try.

    We also see that the tactic [induction] is there to do just this for us
    automatically: it correctly identifies the [P] we want to use and then
    applies the induction principle. *)

(** **** Exercise (medium) *)

(** Find a simple metatheoretic algorithm for generating standard induction
    principles for any inductive type [T]. *)

(** * Parameters and indices *)

(** It's high time to see how to define inductive predicates, relations and,
    more generally, families of types. There are two ways: using parameters
    and indices. After we study both in separation, we will compare them.

    A parametric family of inductive types looks like this: *)

Print option.
(* ===> Inductive option (A : Type) : Type :=
            | Some : A -> option A
            | None : option A *)

(** Because [(A : Type)] appears before the final colon, [option] is not
    a type, but a family of types, parametrized by a type [A]. We can see
    this with the [Check] command. *)

Check option.
(* ===> option : Type -> Type *)

(** Parametric definitions basically tell Coq to define a separate inductive
    type for every possible value of the parameter. In the constructors of
    the type family, the parameter is fixed: every time it appears, it has
    to be the same as in the header of the inductive definition.

    This is sometimes a limitation, but often it's just fine. The most common
    use of parameters is the one presented above: defining polymorphic types,
    containers, relations and predicates. We can easily find more examples of
    such a usage: *)

Print prod.
(* ===> Inductive prod (A B : Type) : Type :=
            | pair : A -> B -> A * B *)

Print sum.
(* ===> Inductive sum (A B : Type) : Type :=
            | inl : A -> A + B
            | inr : B -> A + B *)

Print sigT.
(* ===> Inductive sigT (A : Type) (P : A -> Type) : Type :=
            | existT : forall x : A, P x -> {x : A & P x} *)

Print and.
(* ===> Inductive and (A B : Prop) : Prop :=
            | conj : A -> B -> A /\ B *)

Print or.
(* ===> Inductive or (A B : Prop) : Prop :=
            | or_introl : A -> A \/ B
            | or_intror : B -> A \/ B *)

Print ex.
(* ===> Inductive ex (A : Type) (P : A -> Prop) : Prop :=
            | ex_intro : forall x : A, P x -> exists y, P y *)

(** We see that parameters are engouh to implement a whole bunch of most
    common polymorphic types like products, sums and dependent pairs.

    On the other hand, we can define fully general indexed families of
    types like this: *)

Inductive even : nat -> Prop :=
    | even0 : even 0
    | evenSS : forall n : nat, even n -> even (S (S n)).

(** Here we have nothing before the final colon (the one after [even]),
    so there aren't any parameters. However, after the colon we see
    [nat -> Prop], which means [even] is a family of propositions indexed
    by a natural number, i.e. a predicate on [nat]. We can verify this
    with the command [Check]: *)

Check even.
(* ===> even : nat -> Prop *)

(** In the constructors of [even], the index is not fixed: in [even0] it
    is [0], whereas in [evenSS] it is [S (S n)], which is different from
    [0]. Because of this, indexed families are more general than parametric
    families. *)

(** In the definition of [le], the parameter [n] is fixed in all constructors,

    So, which of these two definitions is better? The answer is that [le]
    is better. To see it, let's take a look at the induction principles. *)

Check le_ind.
(* ===> le_ind :
        forall (n : nat) (P : nat -> Prop),
          P n -> (forall m : nat, n <= m -> P m -> P (S m)) ->

Check le'_ind.

          (forall n m : nat, le' n m -> P n m -> P n (S m)) ->
            forall n n0 : nat, le' n n0 -> P n n0 *)

(** Don't wory if you don't understand these principles yet. We will come
    back to them later. The only thing to you need to notice now is that
    [le'_ind] is more complex than [le_ind].

    Because using parameters means writing less code while having simpler
    induction principles, we should prefer them wherever possible. There
    isn't much more to be said: knowing whether to use parameters or
    indices comes with practice. The only simple heuristic is that often
    you will want types (and propositions) to be parameters.

    If you don't know which one to use, you may use indices first and then
    check whether any one of them is fixed throughout the definition. If
    there is one, you can refactor it into a parameter.

    Let's now proceed to learn about induction principles for families of
    types. *)

(** * Induction principles for type families *)

(** Now that we know how to define parametric and indexed families of types
    and how to derive standard recursion principles for ordinary inductive
    types, the next natural question to consider is how to derive induction
    principles for families of types. Let's take the next step on our path
    to enlightenment.

    Let's start by looking at parametric families. *)

Module MonomorphicList.

(** We will make a new module in order not pollute the global namespace.
    The name [MonomorphicList] means that we're going to define lists
    that can hold elements of only a single type. *)

Parameter A : Type.

(** We will call this type [A]. The command [Parameter] is a synonym of
    [Axiom], [Hypothesis] and a few more. *)

Inductive listA : Type :=
    | nilA : listA
    | consA : A -> listA -> listA.

(** [listA] is just like [list A] (note the lack of space in the first
    name), but it's not parametric. Rather, the [A] is fixed. Let's
    compare the induction principle for [listA] with that of [list]. *)

Check listA_ind.
(* ===> listA_ind :
        forall P : listA -> Prop,
          P nilA ->
          (forall (a : A) (l : listA), P l -> P (consA a l)) ->
            forall l : listA, P l *)

Check list_ind.
(* ===> list_ind :
        forall (A : Type) (P : list A -> Prop),
          P nil ->
          (forall (a : A) (l : list A), P l -> P (a :: l)%list) ->
            forall l : list A, P l *)

(** The principle [listA_ind] says that in order to prove that all [listA]s
    have some property [P : listA -> Prop], it is necessary to prove that
    [P] holds for [nilA] and that if it holds for [l], then it holds for
    [consA a l] where [a : A] is arbitrary. Not a big surprise.

    If we look at the principle for [list], it says nearly the same thing.
    The only difference is that the type [A] is not fixed. It is a parameter
    and this is reflected in the principle: the first quantifier says
    [forall (A : Type)].

    When it comes to induction principles for parametric families, this is
    it: quantifiers have to first quantify over the parameters of the type
    family. The rest of the principle is as usual. *)

End MonomorphicList.

(** We have described only maximal principles for parametric families, but
    don't worry: the minimal ones work exactly the same way, so let's move
    on to indexed families. *)

Module IndexedList.

Inductive ilist : Type -> Type :=
    | inil : forall A : Type, ilist A
    | icons : forall A : Type, A -> ilist A -> ilist A.

(** We will continue the above comparison by looking at the induction
    principle of a polymorphic list type, but written using indices
    instead of parameters. *)

Check icons _ 5 (icons _ 42 (inil _)).
(* ===> icons nat 5 (icons nat 42 (inil nat)) : ilist nat *)

Fail Check icons _ 42 (icons _ true (inil _)).
(* ===> The term "icons bool true (inil bool)" has type "ilist bool"
        while it is expected to have type "ilist nat". *)

(** This type is just like the ordinary [list]: we can have lists of
    elements of any type we like, but we can't put elements of different
    types in the same list. *)

Check ilist_ind.
(* ===> ilist_ind :
        forall P : forall T : Type, ilist T -> Prop,
          (forall A : Type, P A (inil A)) ->
          (forall (A : Type) (a : A) (i : ilist A),
            P A i -> P A (icons A a i)) ->
              forall (T : Type) (i : ilist T), P T i *)

(** The principle is much more complex than that for ordinary [list]s.
    First thing to notice is that there is no quantification over the
    type [T] at the beginning of the principle: [T] in theory can be
    different each time it appears, so we can't quantify it once and
    for all (even if in reality it is always the same).

    Because of this, we havy to quantify over it each time separately.
    This can be seen in the type of the predicate [P]. It is a predicate
    on [ilist T], but in order to be well-typed it has to quantify over
    [T : Type].

    Then the principle looks very similar to that of [list], but as we said
    before, the case for each constructor has to quantify over [T] (here
    called [A]) separately. The end of the principle is also similar, but
    once again a quantification over [T] appears.

    This is it: induction principles for indexed families are about having
    to quantify over the indices separately each time they appear somewhere. *)

End IndexedList.

(** The last thing are definitions having both parameters and indices. They
    adhere to the above rules: in their principles parameters are quantified
    over right at the start and the indices are quantified over separately
    each time they appear. *)

(** * Maximal and minimal principles *)

(** If you look carefully at the induction principle for [le], it seems not
    to follow the rules we saw above. This is because propositions (and all
    families of propositions) are treated a bit differently from ordinary
    types (and type families). Our goal in this subchapter will be to learn
    about this difference.

    Let's compare the induction principles for [prod] and [sum] (which live
    in [Type]) with [and] and [or], their counterparts living in [Prop].
    Before we start, I have to admit that I lied to you once more.

    I told you that for every inductive type we define, Coq generates us
    three induction principles. This is actually the case only for types
    living in [Set] and [Type]. For these in [Prop], only one induction
    principles is generated.

    Therefore, in our comparison we will compare the principles [prod_rect]
    and [sum_rect] to [and_ind] and [or_ind]. *)

Check prod_rect.
(* ===> prod_rect :
        forall (A B : Type) (P : A * B -> Type),
          (forall (a : A) (b : B), P (a, b)) ->

Check sum_rect.
(* ===> sum_rect :
        forall (A B : Type) (P : A + B -> Type),
          (forall a : A, P (inl a)) ->
          (forall b : B, P (inr b)) ->
            forall s : A + B, P s *)

Check and_ind.
(* ===> and_ind :
        forall A B P : Prop,
          (A -> B -> P) -> A /\ B -> P *)

Check or_ind.
(* ===> or_ind :
        forall A B P : Prop,
          (A -> P) -> (B -> P) -> A \/ B -> P *)

(** We could have expected them to be very alike, since the only differences
    between [prod]/[and] and [sum]/[or] (and the associated principles) are
    in the sorts. Yet they are very different. Why is this?

    In order to answer, we have to introduce the distinction between maximal
    and minimal induction principles. All principles you have seen until now
    (not including [and_ind]/[or_ind]) were maximal principles. When we define
    an inductive type or family living in [Set] or [Type], a maximal principle
    is generated for it by default. But when its sort is [Prop], a minimal
    principle is generated.

    It is not the case however that maximal principles are unique to [Set]s
    and [Type]s and minimal principles are unique to [Prop]s. We can have
    both for an inductive type of any sort. To understand the distinction,
    let's generate minimal principles for [prod] and [sum].

    We can do this with the command [Scheme]. By the way, here's a joke:
    Scheme is not a programming language, [Scheme] is just a Coq command
    for generating induction principles. *)

Scheme prod_rect_min := Minimality for prod Sort Type.
Scheme sum_rect_min := Minimality for sum Sort Type.

Check prod_rect_min.
(* ===> prod_ind_min :
        forall (A B : Type) (P : Type),
          (A -> B -> P) -> A * B -> P *)

Check sum_rect_min.
(* ===> sum_ind_min :
        forall (A B : Type) (P : Type),
          (A -> P) -> (B -> P) -> A + B -> P *)

(** These are much more like the principles for [and]/[or] than the maximal
    principles for [prod]/[sum].

    [prod_rect] tells us that in order to define a dependent function
    [forall p : A * B, P p], we have to provide a dependent function
    [forall (a : A) (b : B), P (a, b)]. On the other hand, [prod_rect_min]
    tells us that in order to define a nondependent function [A * B -> P]
    we have to provide another nondependent function [A -> B -> P].

    Likewise [sum_rect] tells us that in order to define a dependent
    function [forall s : A + B, P s] we have to provide two dependent
    functions [forall a : A, P (inl a)] and [forall b : B, P (inr b)].
    On the other hand, [sum_rect_min] tells us that in order to define
    a nondependent function [A + B -> P] we have to provide two
    nondependent functions [A -> P] and [B -> P].

    This is it! The distinction between maximal and minimal principles
    boils down to the fact that maximal principles are for defining
    dependent functions (and proving predicates), whereas the minimal
    ones are for nondependent functions (and proving propositions).

    So, maximal principles are more general than minimal principles.
    The last question that remains is: why are the less general
    principles generated by Coq, if it can generate the more general
    ones?

    To answer this, let's first have a look at the maximal principles
    for [and] and [or]. These can be generated with a different variant
    of the command [Scheme]. *)

Scheme and_ind_max := Induction for and Sort Prop.
Scheme or_ind_max := Induction for or Sort Prop.

Check and_ind_max.
(* ===> and_ind_max :
        forall (A B : Prop) (P : A /\ B -> Prop),
          (forall (a : A) (b : B), P (conj a b)) ->
            forall a : A /\ B, P a *)

Check or_ind_max.
(* ===> or_ind_max :
        forall (A B : Prop) (P : A \/ B -> Prop),
          (forall a : A, P (or_introl a)) ->
          (forall b : B, P (or_intror b)) ->
            forall o : A \/ B, P o *)

(** We now see another side of the coin: the maximal principles are not
    only more general, but also more complex. So, the question boils down
    to why should we prefer simplicity over generality.

    The last thing we have to do is notice that the generality is really
    just the ability to prove properties of proofs of propositions. They
    are uninteresting because when we assume proof irrelevance, for any
    property [P], either all proofs have it or none has.

    However, what if we don't assume proof irrelevance? Even though Coq
    is not proof irrelevant by default — we saw we have to explicitly
    assume irrelevance if we want it — it is proof irrelevant at the
    philosophical level.

    This is because we can't use proofs to construct programs. We can only
    use proofs to construct other proofs and, as we saw, when it comes to
    proofs the only thing that matters is whether they exist or not. In
    other words, Coq's philosophical proof irrelevance comes from the fact
    that it was designed to allow the actual proof irrelevance.

    To sum it up: the mere ability to assume irrelevance makes investigating
    properties of proofs uninteresting and therefore we are not interested
    in having maximal induction principles generated for propositions by
    default. We instead prefer minimal principles. *)

(** **** Exercise (medium) *)

(** Come up with a (metatheoretical) algorithm that can derive a minimal
    principle from a maximal one. Start by comparing maximal and minimal
    principles for some types other than [prod] and [sum]. Make sure it
    also works for indexed families.

    Do you now understand why the induction principle for [le] looks the
    way it does? *)

(** * Mutual induction *)

(** There's one more kind of induction we haven't covered yet: mutual
    induction. It is a very straightforward generalization of ordinary
    induction.

    When we define and inductive type (or an inductive family), we can
    make references to everything we have defined before and also to the
    thing we are currently defining. But we are defining only one thing
    at time. Recall the definition of [even]: *)

Print even.
(* ===> Inductive even : nat -> Prop :=
            | even0 : even 0
            | evenSS : forall n : nat, even n -> even (S (S n)) *)

(** We have a predicate for even numbers, but what about odd numbers? *)

Inductive odd : nat -> Prop :=
    | odd1 : odd 1
    | oddSS : forall n : nat, odd n -> odd (S (S n)).

(** Looks fine. These definitions say that an even number is either zero
    or [2 + n], where [n] is even and that an odd number is either one or
    [2 + n], where [n] is odd.

    In English we can give a different, but equivalent definition of both
    even and odd numbers at once:
    - 0 is even
    - if n is even, then n + 1 is odd
    - if n is odd, then n + 1 is even *)

(** In the above paragraph, we defined evenness and oddness not separately,
    but together. This kind of definition is not specific to English (or any
    other natural language for that matter) — it is also possible to use it
    in Coq and it's called mutual induction. *)

Inductive even' : nat -> Prop :=
    | even'_0 : even' 0
    | even'_S : forall n : nat, odd' n -> even' (S n)

with odd' : nat -> Prop :=
    | odd'_S : forall n : nat, even' n -> odd' (S n).

(** In definitions by mutual induction the first definition is introduced
    by the keyword [Inductive] and each subsequent one by the keyword [with].
    The dot we have to put only after the last definition finishes. It's
    just like the ordinary [Inductive] definitions, but in the constructors
    of a type [T] we can reference all the other types that we are defining
    simultaneously.

    The inductive definition of [even'] and [odd'] mimics what we have seen
    above (we just have to call our predicates [even'] and [odd'] because
    the names [even] and [odd] are already taken).

    Let's see how good this definition is when compared to the previous
    non-inductive definitions. *)

(** This proof attempt fails because we lack the necessary inductive

(** We have the same problem here. An induction hypothesis is missing that

    check the induction principles of [even'] and [odd']. *)

Check even'_ind.

            forall n : nat, even' n -> P n *)

(** A careful glance reveals that there's no induction in this induction
    principle! If you check [odd'_ind], you will see the same thing: no
    induction there.

    This doesn't have any deep philosophical reasons. It's just that for
    some mystical reason Coq by default decides to generate nonmutual
    induction principles even for mutually inductive types. We can easily
    fix it. *)

Scheme even'_odd'_ind := Induction for even' Sort Prop
with odd'_even'_ind := Induction for odd' Sort Prop.

Check even'_odd'_ind.
(* ===> even'_odd'_ind :

            P n e -> P0 (S n) (odd'_S n e)) ->
              forall (n : nat) (e : even' n), P n e *)

(** This is exactly what we need. First, we have two predicates, [P] and [P0].
    [P] is the one we will be proving. It will be automatically inferred by
    Coq. [P0] is the induction hypothesis that was missing in our last attempt
    There are three cases in the principle. This is because our definition had
    three constructors: two for [even'] and one for [odd'].

    Notice that this principle is maximal. There's also the other principle
    — [odd'_even'_ind]. It's there because when we define stuff by mutual
    induction, we have to mutually generate the induction principles too.

    Let's see how to use this principle. *)

Theorem even'_2n :
  forall n : nat, even' n -> exists k : nat, n = 2 * k.
Proof.
  induction 1 using even'_odd'_ind
  with (P0 := fun (n : nat) (H : odd' n) => exists k : nat, n = 2 * k + 1).
    exists 0. trivial.
    destruct IHeven' as [k IH]. exists (S k). lia.
    destruct IHeven' as [k IH]. exists k. lia.
Qed.

(** It was much easier this time. To prove the theorem we use [induction 1]
    as before, but this time we add the clause [using even'_odd'_ind] which
    tells Coq which induction principle to use. Then we use the [with]
    clause to tell Coq how [P0] should look like. We don't have to tell it
    about [P] because it can infer it from the goal.

    Note that the [with] keyword here has nothing to do with the [with] we
    used in the inductive definition. It's just a coincidence of names. We
    have three cases that we solve easily. This shape of induction was what
    we expected at the very beginnig. *)

Theorem odd'_2n_1 :
  forall n : nat, odd' n -> exists k : nat, n = 2 * k + 1.
(* begin hide *)
Proof.
  induction 1 using odd'_even'_ind
  with (P := fun (n : nat) (H : even' n) => exists k : nat, n = 2 * k).
    exists 0. trivial.
    destruct IHodd' as [k IH]. exists (S k). lia.
    destruct IHodd' as [k IH]. exists k. lia.
Qed.
(* end hide *)

(** The second proof is quite similar. But how does the two proofs compare?
    The ones for [even] and [odd] were 14 lines long in total (at least for
    me) and weren't too hard. Quite the opposite. The ones for [even'] and
    [odd'] were 18 lines long in total and we're harder to carry out: we
    had to manually specify the predicates Coq couldn't infer from context.

    So, is mutual induction useless? Not really. *)

Theorem even'_2n' :
  forall n : nat, even' n -> exists k : nat, n = 2 * k
with odd'_2n_1' :
  forall n : nat, odd' n -> exists k : nat, n = 2 * k + 1.
Proof.
  destruct 1.
    exists 0. trivial.
    destruct (odd'_2n_1' _ H) as [k IH]. exists (S k). lia.
  destruct 1.
    destruct (even'_2n' _ H) as [k IH]. exists k. lia.
Qed.

(** The above alternative proof is only 11 lines long, which is better
    than the proofs for [even] and [odd] (but don't take it too seriously
    — proof length measured in lines of code need not be a good measure of
    easiness).

    These theorems are similar to the previous ones, but this time we stated
    and proved both of them at once. We also didn't need to use [induction] 
    (and thus write any predicates explicitly in any place other than the
    theorem statement). This is because using the command [Theorem] in the
    above way adds the inductive hypotheses we need to our context.

    We then proceed as above, but with [destruct] inside of induction.
    We also have to write a bit more in order to destruct our inductive
    hypotheses, but that's not a problem.

    So, is mutual induction useful, if it can give us shorter proofs? I don't
    know a good answer to this question. I can only tell you that I haven't
    seen it used too often. *)

(** * Custom induction principles *)

(** We saw in the previous sections how induction principles look like and
    that Coq generates us one (or rather, three) for every inductive
    definition we make. We also saw that these principles can be derived
    by hand.

    Another fact is that these principles are not unique — quite the
    opposite. Usually there can be many different principles for each
    type: for dependent and non-dependent functions, for true induction
    or just for case analysis, they can even differ by their order of
    taking arguments.

    But even more is possible. Induction principles don't need, in general,
    to be associated with any particular type. We can thus have principles
    for proving facts about relations of type [P : nat -> list bool -> Prop]
    or proving properties of the function [plus].

    We will call the principles Coq generates us "standard" and the ones we
    write ourselves "non-standard" or "custom". In this subchapter we will
    learn to devise and implement non-standard principles and to use them
    with standard tactics like [destruct] and [induction].

    We will also learn about the basics of functional induction, a powerful
    tool for proving properties of recursive functions. *)

Definition bool_ind'
  (P : bool -> Prop) (f : P false) (t : P true) (b : bool) : P b :=
match b with
    | true => t
    | false => f
end.

(** This is a nonstandard case analysis principle for [bool]. The only thing
    that makes it different from the principle [bool_ind] is the order of
    arguments: it takes  that of type [P false] first, whereas [bool_ind]'s
    first argument has type [P true]. It is obvious that it is correct,
    because we can prove [P] for [true] and [false] in any order we like. *)

Definition bool_ind'' :
  forall P : bool -> Prop,
    P false -> P true ->
      forall b : bool, P b.
Proof.
  destruct b; assumption.
Qed.

(** We can also use the tactic language to simply prove the principle as a
    theorem. This doesn't make much difference now, but for more complex
    principles it is often easier to establish them that way.

    But how do we use such nonstndard principles? Standard case analysis on
    the term [t] is usually performed by using the tactic [destruct t]. Our
    nonstandard one can be likewise performed with the tactic [destrct t
    using our_principle]. Of course it can also be used directly with [apply],
    but we already saw that it isn't the best possibility.

    Let's see both principles in action. *)

Theorem negb_involutive'' :
  forall b : bool, negb (negb b) = b.
Proof.
  destruct b; cbn. all: trivial.
Restart.
  destruct b using bool_ind; cbn. all: trivial.
Restart.
  destruct b using bool_ind'; cbn. all: trivial.
Restart.
  destruct b using bool_ind''; cbn. all: trivial.
Qed.

(** Here we see that the tactic [destruct b] is in fact equivalent to
    [destruct b using bool_ind], in which the standard induction principle
    is named explicitly. In these two equivalent cases, our first subgoal
    is [true = true] and the second is [false = false]. On the contrary,
    when we use one of our custom principles, our first goal is of the form
    [false = false] and the second is [true = true].

    Let's see a custom principle for [nat]. *)

Fixpoint nat_ind_2
  (P : nat -> Prop) (H0 : P 0) (H1 : P 1)
  (HSS : forall n : nat, P n -> P (S (S n)))
  (n : nat) : P n :=
match n with
    | 0 => H0
    | 1 => H1
    | S (S n') => HSS n' (nat_ind_2 P H0 H1 HSS n')
end.

Fixpoint nat_ind_2'
  (P : nat -> Prop) (H0 : P 0) (H1 : P 1)
  (HSS : forall n : nat, P n -> P (S (S n)))
  (n : nat) : P n.
Proof.
  destruct n as [| [| n']].
    apply H0.
    apply H1.
    apply HSS. apply nat_ind_2'; assumption.
Defined.

(** In case of [nat], we can customize our induction principle more than
    by just changing the order of the arguments. For example, we can do
    "induction by 2's". This means that rather than starting at [0] and
    applying [S] once in each step, we have two base cases, [0] and [1],
    and we apply [S] twice in each step.

    This principle is correct because we can generate all natural numbers
    this way: starting from [0] and applying [S] twice in each step we
    can generate all even numbers, whereas starting from [1] and applying
    [S] twice in each step we can generate all odd numbers. Because each
    natural number is either even or odd, we see that our custom principle
    covers all cases.

    We also see that when our principles have recursion, defining them with
    tactics is easier than without tactics. *)

Require Import Div2.

(** Div2 is a module that contains the function [div2], which performs
    integer division by two. Here is its definition: *)

              | S (S n') => S (div2 n')
          end
          : nat -> nat *)

(** Note: we use [Eval compute] instead of [Print] because [div2] is only
    a notation.

    We see that [div2] is defined differently than [plus] or [mult]. These
    two have just two cases in their respective [match]es: [0] and [S n'],
    whereas [div2] has [0], [1] and [S (S n')]. Let's try proving some
    theorem.  *)

Theorem lt_div2' :
  forall n : nat, 0 < n -> div2 n < n.
Proof.
  induction n as [| n']; cbn; intros; auto.
    destruct n'; cbn in *; auto.
Restart.
  induction n as [| | n'] using nat_ind_2; cbn; intros; auto.
    destruct n' as [| [| n'']]; cbn in *; auto.
      unfold lt in *. apply le_n_S. apply le_S. apply IHn'. apply le_n_S.
        apply le_0_n.
Qed.

(** Trying induction on [n] using the standard induction principle doesn't
    help us much. A kind of a "mismatch" occurs: when we have [n'] in the
    hypothesis, we have [match n' with ...] in the goal and vice versa. This
    is because the shape of induction in the standard principle is different
    from the shape of recursion that was used to define [div2]. If we use
    the custom principle, we get rid of that problem and we are able to prove
    the goal easily.

    So, our nonstandard principles are no different from the standard ones,
    we just have to create them manually and type a bit more in order to
    use them... or do we? *)

    principle for lists, but what if we are too lazy to do that?

    Don't worry, there's a solution called [functional induction]. It is a

(** The last thing left is to pack the above lemma into a case analysis
    principle. We will call it [bool_fun_ind], even though it has nothing
    to do with induction.

    This is it! We can now do case analysis when proving properties of
    boolean functions. But there's a problem: I can't think of any useful
    property of boolean functions that can be proved by case analysis but
    not with some other method. *)

(** **** Exercise (medium) *)

(** Try to come up with such a property. *)

(** * Functions and functional relations *)

(** After you have learned about the commands [Function] and [Functional
    Scheme], you may be wondering how they work. We will try to answer
    this question now, but it will be easier if we first see how we can
    use inductive families to represent functions.

    First we have to explicitly spell out what a function is. There are two
    widely used definitions:
    - the computer scientist's one, which equates functions with algorithms.
      They are always computable, which means we can implement and run them
      on a computer to get the result. Coq functions are of this kind.
    - the mathematician's one, which equates functions with functional
      relations, which are relations with additional properties. These need
      not be computable. *)

(** The second meaning of "function" stems from set theory and is widely
    used in mathematics. Here a function is synonyomous with its graph.
    A graph of a function is a relation that relates the function's inputs
    to its output.

    Let's see an example underlining the difference between these two. *)

Function div2 (n : nat) : nat :=
match n with
    | 0 => 0
    | 1 => 0
    | S (S n') => S (div2 n')
end.

(** Note: we use [Function] only to get the functional induction principle
    so that we will later be able to compare it to our own.

    [div2] is an ordinary structurally recursive function. Nothing fancy. *)

Inductive div2_rel : nat -> nat -> Prop :=
    | div2_rel_even : forall n : nat, div2_rel (2 * n) n
    | div2_rel_odd : forall n : nat, div2_rel (2 * n + 1) n.

(** [div2_rel] is an inductive relation defined like this:
    - the result of dividing [2 * n] by [2] is [n]
    - the result of dividing [2 * n + 1] by [2] is [n] *)

(** The difference is quite stark: the recursive one ([div2]) tells us how
    to divide a number by two (how to compute the result). The inductive one
    ([div2_rel]) tells us what is the relation between inputs and outputs of
    a function that divides its argument by two. Nonetheless these two
    formulations of division are somehow equivalent. *)

(** Now that we know inductive relations can represent graphs of functions,

(** Note: in the names of the following functions we utilize the naming
    conventions of [Function] and [Functional Scheme], but add a ['] at
    the end.

    No doubt this is the graph of [div2], because this definition follows
    precisely [div2]'s definition: there's one constructor for each case
    in its pattern match. Therefore, unlike the original [div2_rel], it is
    not well suited for a specification of [div2].

    So, what's the point? *)

(** The point is that [R_div2'_ind], the induction principle for the graph
    of [div2] is very much like [div2_ind], the functional induction principle
    for [div2]. This fact is overshadowed by weirdness of [div2_ind] (it was,
    after all, generated automagically). There's something very deep going on
    here.

    Let's ask ourselves a related question: how to prove a property of a given
    function f by induction?

    The simple answer is: we have to apply the right induction principle and
    then finish the proof. But which induction principle is the right one?
    A philosophical answer would be: the one that best matches the function's
    recursion shape. But which one is it?

    Recall that every induction principle tells us how to use a value of some
    inductively defined type (or type family) to define dependent functions.
    Therefore, every induction principle is associated to some type or type
    family. So the question boils down to this: which inductive type has the
    most similar shape to that of f's recursion shape?

    The ultimate answer is: the graph of f (using the definition that follows
    exactly f's recursion's shape). Now that you know this illuminating fact,
    let's see how to derive the functional induction principle for [div2] by
    hand. *)

Fixpoint rev_acc {A : Type} (l acc : list A) : list A :=
match l with
    | [] => acc
    | h :: t => rev_acc t (h :: acc)
end.

(** [rev_acc] works by putting its argument's head to the accumulator until
    its argument is empty, in which case it returns the accumulator. It's
    clear that if we call it with an empty accumulator, then in result we
    will get its argument reversed. Let's try to prove that. *)

Theorem rev_acc_spec_weak :
  forall (A : Type) (l : list A), rev_acc l [] = rev l.
Proof.
  induction l as [| h t]; cbn.
    trivial.
Abort.

(** The proof failed miserably. Our goal mentions [rev_acc t [h]], but
    the induction hypothesis is about [rev_acc t []]. There is no way
    to solve this problem the way we did before: by rearranging the
    order of quantifications or by using [generalize dependent].

    This is a problem of fundamentally different nature — the induction
    hypothesis is too weak because the theorem itself is too weak. To
    go around this, we have to devise a stronger version of the theorem,
    but how to do this?

    Let's take a glance at the arguments of [rev_acc]: the second one is [[]].
    Let's try to generalize the theorem to an arbitrary [acc : list A].
    If we run [rev_acc] with an arbitrary accumulator, it will prepend its
    reversed argument to the accumulator and then return it. Let's try this
    as our theorem. *)

Theorem rev_acc_spec_strong :
  forall (A : Type) (l acc : list A),
    rev_acc l acc = rev l ++ acc.
Proof.
  induction l as [| h t]; cbn; intros.
    trivial.
    rewrite IHt. rewrite <- app_assoc. cbn. trivial.
Qed.

(** This time our induction hypothesis talks about a general [acc] and not
    just [[]], so we can easily use it with [rewrite]. Now we can derive the
    weaker version of the theorem we first tried to prove. *)

Theorem rev_acc_spec_weak :
  forall (A : Type) (l : list A), rev_acc l [] = rev l.
Proof.
  intros. rewrite rev_acc_spec_strong. rewrite app_nil_r. trivial.
Qed.

(** The technique presented above allows us to explain the paradoxical fact
    that proving a stronger theorem may be easier than proving a weaker one,
    at least in the case of proofs by induction.

    The explanation is: the stronger the theorem, the stronger the induction
    hypothesis. Sometimes the increase in the induction hypothesis' strength
    will be greater than the increase in the theorem's difficulty and thus
    the proof will be easier. Other times, the stronger theorem will actually
    be harder to prove. *)

(** * Technical shortcomings of [induction] *)

(** [induction] is a very smart tactic: it can introduce quantified
    variables into the context, infer the predicate we're trying to
    prove and many more. But there is one situation in which its
    behaviour is really stupid and unexpected.

    Let's see a somewhat complicated example, taken from Coq'Art.
    We will define a simple imperative programming language and
    then try to prove a fact by induction. *)

Section little_semantics.

Variables Var aExp bExp : Set.

(** Note: there's a reason for using [Axioms] instead of, say, [Variables],
    that will be explained later.

    We will use [Var] to represent variables, [aExp] for arithmetic
    expressions and [bExp] for boolean expressions.*)

Inductive instr : Set :=
    | Skip : instr
    | Assign : Var -> aExp -> instr
    | Seq : instr -> instr -> instr
    | While : bExp -> instr -> instr.

(** There are three kinds of instructions: the empty instruction [Skip],
    assignment [Assign] and the while loop [While]. They can be sequenced
    using [Seq]. *)

Axioms
  (state : Set)
  (update : state -> Var -> Z -> option state)
  (evalA : state -> aExp -> option Z)
  (evalB : state -> bExp -> option bool).

(** We also assume [state] for representing the state of programs. This state
    will be updated with [update]. We can "evaluate" arithmetic expressions
    using [evalA] and boolean expressions using [evalB]. *)

Inductive exec : state -> instr -> state -> Prop :=
    | execSkip :
        forall s : state, exec s Skip s
    | execAssign :
        forall (s1 s2 : state) (v : Var) (a : aExp) (k : Z),
          evalA s1 a = Some k -> update s1 v k = Some s2 ->
            exec s1 (Assign v a) s2
    | execSeq :
        forall (s1 s2 s3 : state) (i1 i2 : instr),
          exec s1 i1 s2 -> exec s2 i2 s3 ->
            exec s1 (Seq i1 i2) s3
    | execWhileTrue :
        forall (s1 s2 s3 : state) (i : instr) (be : bExp),
          evalB s1 be = Some true ->
          exec s1 i s2 ->
          exec s2 (While be i) s3 ->
            exec s1 (While be i) s3
    | execWhileFalse :
        forall (s : state) (i : instr) (be : bExp),
          evalB s be = Some false -> exec s (While be i) s.

(** This is the relation that describes how to execute programs. [Skip] does
    nothing, [Assign] and [While] work as expected. [Seq i1 i2] means "execute
    i1 and then i2". *)

Hint Constructors instr exec : core.

(** We want to prove a rule for while from Hoare logic. It says, roughly,
    that if we execute a while loop and if a loop invariant [P] holds
    before the loop and after each iteration, then after the last iteration
    [P] also holds and moreover the condition of the while loop is false
    (for otherwise the loop wouldn't have terminated). *)

Theorem HoareWhileRule :
  forall (P : state -> Prop) (b : bExp) (i : instr) (s s' : state),
    (forall s1 s2 : state, P s1 -> evalB s1 b = Some true ->
      exec s1 i s2 -> P s2) -> P s -> exec s (While b i) s' ->
        P s' /\ evalB s' b = Some false.
Proof.

Restart.
  intros. inversion H1; subst.

  intros. remember (While b i) as w.
  induction H1; intros; inversion Heqw; subst; eauto.
Qed.

(** We attempt to prove the theorem by induction on the hypothesis
    [H1 : exec s (While b i) s'] as this seems to be the only reasonable
    option. However, we fail miserably: [induction H1] gives us 5 subgoals
    that we can't solve.

    Clearly [H1] could have been created only with the constructors
    [execWhileTrue] and [execWhileFalse], but [induction] wants us to
    consider all 5 constructors. If we try [destruct], the same happens,
    but when we use [inversion], we get only 2 subgoals as expected. Why
    is this so?

    It's all very simple: if we do induction on a term whose type contains
    non-variables, [induction] and [destruct] both mess up and "forget"
    the form of this particular term, leaving us with unprovable subgoals.

    In our case, the type of [H1] is [exec s (While b i) s']. The arguments
    of [exec] are [s], [While b i] and [s'], of which [s] and [s'] are
    variables and [While b i] is not. So, both [induction] and [destruct]
    forget all information regarding the term [While b i].

    The situation is easy to deal with: we have to replace the problematic
    term [While b i] with a fresh variable [w], keeping an equality saying
    that [w = While b i]. This little bookkeeping saves us from losing
    the desired information.

    Two questions remain: why [inversion] succeeds, when [induction] and
    [destruct] fail? The answer is: [inversion] was crafted specially for
    not losing information in such cases. So, why doesn't [destruct] and
    [induction] work that way?

    As for [destruct], if you want it not to lose information, you can
    use [inversion] anyway. As for [induction]: it is supposed to be a
    basic and simple tactic, whereas [inversion] tends to generate very
    large proofterms. For example, in the above proofscript, after [intros]
    the proofterm is only 4 lines long, but after [intros. inversion H1] it
    is 214 lines long (you can check this yourself with the command [Show
    Proof]). This is the price of [inversion]. *)

(** **** Exercise (hard) *)

(** Write a tactic [replace_nonvars H] that replaces all nonvariables with
    variables in the hypothesis [H] and adds appropriate equalities to the
    context. Combine this tactic with the tactic [generalize_IH] that you
    implemented in one of the earlier exercises and some more tinkering to
    get a tactic [ind H], which:
    - generalizes the inductive hypothesis
    - replaces nonvariables with variables in the inductive hypothesis
    - does induction
    - inverses and substitutes all necessary equalities
    - cleans the mess it may have created in the context
    - finishes off easy subgoals with some basic automation *)
